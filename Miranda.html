                "Do any of you have a completely unremarkable friend or maybe a houseplant I could go to dinner with on Saturday night?" - Miranda
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="letter">M</span>iranda is smart, self-assured and proud of her achievements. She raises the bar for herself continually, be it in her professional or personal life. She made partner in her law firm and was able to buy her own pre-war apartment on the Upper West Side (Take a look inside). However, she's struggled with her love life and, at times, abandoned the pursuit of love altogether. Tough and down-to-earth, she doesn't open up easily, masking her vulnerability with cynicism and self-deprecating humor. Throughout her long-term relationship with Steve, she had bouts of doubt about her true feelings and was constantly frustrated with Steve's laid-back approach to life.
            </p>
            <p>
                His attempts to bring their relationship to a new level only seemed to push her farther away. They gave up, but managed to salvage their friendship. Much to her dismay, Miranda's post-Steve dates haven't panned out. When Steve lost one of his testicles to cancer, Miranda boosted his male morale with a night of passion. Shortly after, she realized she was pregnant. She had every intention of having an abortion, but minutes before the procedure, she had a change of heart and decided to keep the baby. She wondered if this was her last chance at motherhood. As her pregnancy progressed, she feared she didn't have a maternal instinct and struggled to juggle her demanding career with her new identity as a mommy-to-be. Nature took its course, and, with Carrie and Steve by her side, she gave birth to Brady Hobbes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not shockingly, Miranda grappled with her new role as a single working mom. She had to come to terms with how being a parent would change her relationships with her friends and any new man that might come along. And Miranda and Steve accidentally rekindled their sexual relationship one night, forcing Miranda to take a hard look at her complicated attachment to Steve. A brief relationship with the dashing Dr. Robert Leeds ultimately ended, due to Miranda's feelings for Steve, but fortunately, Steve's feelings proved to be mutual and the two decided to make another go at it.

            <h1>Fashion Sence</h1>
            <p>
                For pragmatic Miranda, fashion is more about getting the job done than following the latest trends. By day, her lawyerly look tends towards smart tailored suits. This year we've seen her experiment more with color, especially rich wines and purples that accent her fiery red crop. Though she tends toward casual sportswear on the weekend, she keeps up with the girls just fine in sexy slip dresses and funky accessories. Take a closer look at Miranda's style in our fashion slideshows.
