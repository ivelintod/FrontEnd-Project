                So why is the show so often portrayed as a set of empty, static cartoons, an embarrassment to womankind? It’s a classic misunderstanding, I think, stemming from an unexamined hierarchy: the assumption that anything stylized (or formulaic, or pleasurable, or funny, or feminine, or explicit about sex rather than about violence, or made collaboratively) must be inferior. Certainly, the show’s formula was strict: usually four plots—two deep, two shallow—linked by Carrie’s voice-over. The B plots generally involved one of the non-Carrie women getting laid; these slapstick sequences were crucial to the show’s rude rhythms, interjecting energy and rupturing anything sentimental. (It’s one reason those bowdlerized reruns on E! are such a crime: with the literal and figurative fucks edited out, the show is a rom-com.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Most unusually, the characters themselves were symbolic. As I’ve written elsewhere—and argued, often drunkenly, at cocktail parties—the four friends operated as near-allegorical figures, pegged to contemporary debates about women’s lives, mapped along three overlapping continuums. The first was emotional: Carrie and Charlotte were romantics; Miranda and Samantha were cynics. The second was ideological: Miranda and Carrie were second-wave feminists, who believed in egalitarianism; Charlotte and Samantha were third-wave feminists, focussed on exploiting the power of femininity, from opposing angles. The third concerned sex itself. At first, Miranda and Charlotte were prudes, while Samantha and Carrie were libertines. Unsettlingly, as the show progressed, Carrie began to glide toward caution, away from freedom, out of fear.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every conversation the friends had, at brunch or out shopping, amounted to a “Crossfire”-like debate. When Carrie sleeps with a dreamy French architect and he leaves a thousand dollars by her bed, she consults her friends. “Money is power. Sex is power,” Samantha argues. “Therefore, getting money for sex is simply an exchange of power.” “Don’t listen to the dime-store Camille Paglia,” Miranda shoots back. The most famous such conversation took place four episodes in, after Charlotte’s boyfriend asked her to have anal sex. The friends pile into a cab for a raucous debate about whether her choice is about power-exchange (Miranda) or about finding a fun new hole (Samantha). “I’m not a hole!” Charlotte protests, and they hit a pothole. “What was that?” Charlotte asks. “A preview,” Miranda and Samantha say in unison, and burst out laughing.

            </p>
            <p>
                The show’s basic value system aligns with Carrie: romantic, second-wave, libertine. But “Sex and the City” ’s real strength was its willingness not to stack the deck: it let every side make a case, so that complexity carried the day. When Carrie and Aidan break up, they are both right. When Miranda and Carrie argue about her move to Paris, they are both right. The show’s style could be brittle, but its substance was flexible, in a way that made the series feel peculiarly broad-ranging, covering so much ground, so fleetly, that it became easy to take it for granted.

            <p>
                Sex and the City is embraced as a feminist Bible on screen. The TV series is based on Candace Bushnell’s former column in the New York Observer. It is about four women in New York and their adventures, specifically their romantic and sexual and adventures. It ran for six seasons from 1998 and then became a feature film. And because the human appetite for watching women being idiots is insatiable, a sequel opens next week.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why do we cry “feminist”? It’s because the female characters all work, earn money and talk about sex a lot, in the way that daft teenage girls do. There is Miranda the lawyer, Samantha the nymphomaniac and Charlotte the prig. Holding them together is Carrie Bradshaw, a journalist and supposed Everywoman, played by Sarah Jessica Parker. But be warned, sister – Sex and the City is to feminism what sugar is to dental care.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first clue is in the opening credits of the television show. Carrie is standing in a New York street in a ballet skirt, the sort that toddlers wear. She is dressed, unmistakably, as a child. And, because she is sex columnist on a newspaper, a bus wearing a huge photo of her in a tiny dress trundles past. “Carrie Bradshaw knows good sex,” says the bus. And there, before any dialogue hits your ears, you have the two woeful female archetypes that Sex and the City loves – woman as sex object and woman as child.

            </p>
            <p>
                The fact that Carrie is a journalist is supposed to imply that she is a kind of thinker, and is intellectually engaged with the world she shops in. Each episode of the TV series is about a sex column she is writing. She asks herself a question, spends the episode investigating it and usually comes to the conclusion that she has no conclusion. She is, simply, the worst journalist in the history of the world. Her self-exploration is a joke.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is acknowledged when, towards the end of the series, she washes up at Vogue, the worst magazine in the history of the world. She claims to hang out in the library but, in six series and one film, the only book she ever picks up is Love Letters of Great Men.

                There's been a lot of nonsense written about SATC the TV series in recent weeks, often by journalists who never watched it (in fact, one writer of a recent piece cited that achievement as a point of pride before then listing his reasons for hating the show, reasons he presumably pulled out of his ass).
            </p>
            <p>
                But the truth is, the show was fantastic: smart, funny, warm and wise, a far cry from the "middle-aged women having embarrassing sex with various unsuitable partners" cliche that the above writer used. It was about four smart women, three of whom had no interest in getting married. Candace Bushnell's original book on which the show was based was good, but the show was great. Yes, there were stupid puns (although I maintain that Carrie's response to Big when he said he was moving to California because he was tired – "If you're tired you take a napa, you don't move to Napa" – is pretty funny). And, yes, there was sex and shopping. But unlike in the films, that's not all there was, and that wasn't all the characters cared about. What elevated the show way above the normal chickflick tat, and way above the films, was that it had genuine emotional truth. It sang with lines that you knew had come from real life ("How can I have this baby? I barely had time to schedule this abortion" being quite possibly my all-time favourite) and plots that went beyond the limiting convention of cliche. Samantha's breast cancer, for example, showed not only how scary and sad cancer (obviously) is, but also how boring, sweaty and plain inconvenient it is, too.
            </p>
            <p>
                But now, treacherously, the films confirm all the worst and wrong assumptions men, mainly made about the show and its largely female audience. The most humiliating example of this was the review of the first film in the New Yorker by Anthony Lane, one of my most revered journalists. Lane wrote: "I walked into the theatre hoping for a nice evening and came out as a hardline Marxist, my head a whirl of closets, delusions, and blunt-clawed cattiness. There is a deep sadness in the sight of Carrie and her friends defining themselves by their ability to snare and keep a man." Oh, Anthony! You're right, but it wasn't always thus!
            </p>
            <p>
                Then there's the issue of race. The TV series was, quite rightly, criticised for rarely featuring non-Caucasian characters. The first film's nervy response to this was to include a black character, but as Carrie's assistant, played by Jennifer Hudson, who is cravenly grateful for Carrie's designer cast-offs, and then returns in the end to St Louis, where black people more belong. The second film goes even further, because King sends the characters to Abu Dhabi. Not since 1942's Arabian Nights has orientalism been portrayed so unironically. All Middle Eastern men are shot in a sparkly light with jingly jangly music just in case you didn't get that these dusky people are exotic and different. Even leaving aside the question of why anyone would go on holiday to Abu Dhabi, everyone who has ever watched a TV show knows that the first rule is: don't take characters out of their usual environment. The term "jump the shark" was even coined about the series-destroying episode of Happy Days in which the characters go on holiday and Fonzie water-skis over a shark. This rule was repeatedly proven in the TV series of Sex and the City as the weakest episodes always involved the women leaving New York (two forays to California, one to Atlantic City) and it is roundly proven here because the film-makers' knowledge of the Middle East begins and ends with Lawrence of Arabia, whereas part of the fun of the show was the in-the-know details about Manhattan. And speaking of Manhattan, the only ethnic minorities you see there are waiting behind counters to sell the women expensive handbags.
            </p>
            <p>
                The death of Sex and the City is not just a shame for fans, but for all women with higher expectations of movies about women than a compendium of cliches from the Daily Mail. Carrie, you may have bought a lot of shoes in these movies, but ultimately, you sold out.
