                <span class="letter">W</span>hen Charlotte needed a divorce lawyer to bring an end to her marriage to Trey, she found herself in an interesting dilemma. She naturally wanted to hire a good looking legal representative, but she found herself unable to be cold-blooded and hard-nosed around an attractive lawyer, a definite problem considering the upcoming battle with Bunny MacDougal.
</p>
            <p>
                Enter Harry Goldenblatt.
            </p>
            <p>
                Harry was the total opposite of what Charlotte desired from her men. He was bald and chewed with his mouth open. Charlotte knew that she could let her guard down around Harry, since she would never fall for anybody like him. That is, until she did.
            </p>
            <p>
                Charlotte kept denying her feelings for Harry, both to herself and her friends. She kept using his hairy back and lack of social skills to justify not wanting to be with him, but deep down, her feelings grew every single time they got together.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately for Charlotte, Harry dropped a bombshell on her at Bobby and Bitsy's wedding, telling her that he could only marry a Jew after she finally admitted her feelings. Not one to give up so easily, Charlotte actually converted for Harry. The couple had a few rocky moments, but eventually realized that they were destined to be wed. The wedding itself was anything but perfect, but Harry and Charlotte seem destined to have a successful marriage.
