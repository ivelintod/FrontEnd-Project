                "Sex with an ex can be depressing. If it's good, you don't have it anymore; if it's bad, you just had sex with an ex."
                - Samantha
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="letter">S</span>cintillating Samantha is a successful PR exec who knows what she wants - and most of the time, she gets it. She radiates confidence in everything she does, whether it's landing a star client, getting a table at the trendiest restaurant or bedding the hottest guy in a room. Samantha embraces her uninhibited sexuality with a diverse (and large) group of lovers, from wrestling coaches to power bachelors to a studly farmer. Forget wedding dreams; Samantha takes lust over love any night, and she's proud of it. Once, she even experimented with lesbian love, but when her "girlfriend" demanded more intimacy, Samantha knew it wasn't going to work out.
</p>
            <p>
                Her next conquest, the unabashedly confident ladies' man and hotel magnate Richard Wright, seemed Samantha's perfect match. But as the sexual affair progressed, Samantha found herself feeling much more than lust, and she eventually declared her love to Richard. Somewhat resistant, Richard offered to try monogamy. When Samantha caught him cheating on her, she was thrust into uncharted territory : the land of the broken-hearted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Samantha gave Richard one more chance, but the trust had been broken, and around every corner she imagined he was cheating. She chose to walk away from him, scarred but with her dignity.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Samantha met the sexy Smith Jerrod, the last thing on her mind was a long-term monogamous relationship. However, the "Absolut Hunk" got under her skin like no one had ever been able to do. Despite her constant denials (both to the girls and to herself), she found herself completely falling for Smith. Has Ms. Jones finally found herself the one man that can keep her satisfied in every way? Only time will tell.
            </p>
            <h1>Fashion Sence</h1>
            <p>
                Samantha's high-power lifestyle demands a wardrobe ready to make a statement at every occasion. For work, she gravitates towards body-accentuating suits in bold colors and at night she turns up the volume with racy ensembles that show off her bombshell figure and personality.
